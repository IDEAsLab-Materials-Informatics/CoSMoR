## E01-hardness-HEAs
This example shows how a ML model can be trained and then used with CoSMoR.
### Directory 'ml-training'
Contains a demo code to train a machine learning model for hardness prediction in high-entropy alloys. Note that the ML model developed here is only for demonstration and its performance has not been optimized.
###  Directory 'use-cosmor':
Contains the code showing how cosmor can be used to probe the decision-making process along continuous composition pathways using pre-trained ML models. Here, trained models from 'ml-training' directory have been used.
