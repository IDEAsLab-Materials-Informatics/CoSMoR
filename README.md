### About **CoSMoR**
**CoSMoR** extracts **EXACT** contribution of each feature towards the overall decision-making process along continuous composition pathways. It thus provides material-specific insights as to how exactly does the ML model makes its predictions.

- **Where can you apply CoSMoR?**
  - It is applicable to all compositional machine learning models wherein the input features are a direct function of material composition and elemental properties.
- **What is a continuous composition pathway: A<sub>x</sub>-B<sub>1-x</sub>?**
  - Suppose you have a baseline composition B. Now if you add A to this base material, then A<sub>x<\sub>
